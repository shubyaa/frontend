# Reactify - Your Groovy Spotify App

## Appendix

Welcome to Reactify, where the code is as smooth as your favorite playlist on Spotify! This project is all about bringing the rhythm to your React world, turning your app into a jukebox of awesomeness.

Feel free to customize it further to fit the specifics of your project and add your own personal touch!

## Features

- Dark mode
- Completely Made with React and Tailwind CSS
- used with React Hooks
- Well handled states and UI using Tailwind.

## Documentation

Nothing much as a **DOCUMENTAION**. I find it useful though as a practice to directly test your custom APIs. Do check out the background gradient change while selecting any tab.
